# fifa-trading-bot
Many bots simply utilize speed to outbid real humans, or automate the process of continuously bidding and reselling items for a tiny profit and accumulating those profits over time.

This script web scrapes price information from fansites, scans the entire marketplace (narrowed by criterias/filters) to identify and execute arbitrage opportunities in the virtual FIFA stock market. 

This has resulted in in-game profits that would otherwise require real money, in-depth knowledge of in-game trends, or many, many hours spent playing the game itself.
